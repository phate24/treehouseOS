## Mission

Homo sapiens is shaped by two key relationships: one with nature and the other with our own minds. We're the only species that knows it knows. As it turns out, this privilege is not forever, and what's more, we take it away from ourselves. Commercial tech — smartphones, social media, news, games — is taking up more and more of our mental space, not only pulling us away from nature but weakening our ability (and need) to think.

As adults, we're privileged. We remember a time before or just as the internet took off. We've been to the 'treehouse'.

But our children don't have that privilege. The web is their world. Social media and junk information are shaping the way they see things, and it's not a pretty picture. Recent studies show that depression rates among children and teens have nearly doubled in recent years, with teen girls three times more likely to experience depression than boys. Between 2016 and 2022 alone, the rate of antidepressant use among children and adolescents in the U.S. increased by more than 65%.

Today's young generations are living in civilized cages when what they need is a **treehouse**.

We don't deny the world we live in. Technology is here, and it can be a beautiful thing.

Our mission is to build a strong generation that revolves around three `personas`:

+ `explorer` - fostering curiosity about the world and respect for nature
+ `freethinker` - embracing first-principles thinking, critical analysis, and the courage to question what doesn't fit
+ `creator` - understanding technology, reasoning, and programming
