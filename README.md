# TreehouseOS
Open School. Open Source. Operating System

## The Idea
Homo sapiens is shaped by two key relationships: one with nature and the other with our own minds. We're the only species that knows it knows. As it turns out, this privilege is not forever, and furthermore, we are able to take it away. Commercial tech - smartphones, social media, news, games - is taking up more and more of our mental space, not only pulling us away from nature, but weakening our ability (and need) to think.

As adults, we're privileged. We remember a time before or just as the internet took off. We've been to the 'treehouse'.

But our children don't have that privilege. The web is their world. Social media and junk information are shaping the way they see things, and it's not a pretty picture. Recent studies show that depression rates among children and teens have nearly doubled in recent years, with teen girls three times more likely to experience depression than boys. Between 2016 and 2022 alone, the rate of antidepressant use among children and adolescents in the U.S. will increase by more than 65%.

Today's young generations are living in civilized cages when what they need is a **treehouse**.

We don't deny the world we live in. Technology is here and it can be a beautiful thing. Our mission is to build a strong generation that revolves around three key personas:

`Explorer` - fostering curiosity about the world and respect for nature

`Freethinker` - embracing first-principles thinking, critical analysis, and the courage to question what doesn't fit

`Creator` - understanding technology, reasoning, and programming

## The Project
**OS stands for Open School**

The concept of a public charity that helps fund educators and contributors working to shape the future-proof generation of `explorers`, `freethinkers`, and `creators`.

**OS stands for Operating System**

Anyone who has been in a treehouse knows that good construction starts with a good plan. Our goal is to build a self-organizing, protocol-driven charity that can grow with a low operating budget and is not dependent on the founders.

Created today based on a set of rules, TreehouseOS will eventually become software - an operating system.

**OS stands for Open Source**

We want to prove that technology can do a lot of good. That is why we want to make use of its biggest advantage - scalability. The project will be public, available to contributors everywhere.
